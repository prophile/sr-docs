The Power Board distributes power to the SR kit from the battery. It provides
six individual general-purpose power outputs along with a separate power connector
for the Brain Board.

Connectors
----------

There are six power output connectors on the board, labelled L0–L3, H0, and H1.
These are enabled when your robot code is started, and supply around 11.1V
(±15%). They should be used to connect to the motor and servo board power
inputs. The "H" connectors will supply more current than the "L" connectors.

The 5V connectors can be used to connect low-current devices that take 5V
inputs, such as the Brain Board.

There is also a Micro USB B connector which should be used to connect the Brain
Board for control of the power board.

Finally, there are connectors for external Start and On\|Off switches. You may
connect any push-to-make latching switch for the On\|Off button, or a
push-to-make button for the start button.

<div class="info">If you intend to use only the internal On|Off switch, you
must connect a CamCon to the On|Off connector with a wire connecting one pin to
the other pin on the same connector.</div>

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                         | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------
| PWR\|FLAT       | Green when powered, orange when the battery is low | Green
| 5V              | Green when 5V is being supplied | Green


Controls
--------

| Control        | Use
|----------------|----------------------------
| ON\|OFF        | Turns the power board on, when used in conjunction with an external switch
| START          | Starts your program (can be used instead of the tablet interface)


Case Dimensions
---------------

The case measures 83x99x24mm. Don't forget that the cables will stick out.
