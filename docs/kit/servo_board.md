Servo Board
===========

The Servo Board can be used to control up to 12 RC servos.
Many devices are available that can be controlled as servos, such as RC motor speed controllers, and these can also be used with the board.

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                | Initial power-up state
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------
| Power           | The board is powered   | On
-->

There are 8 servo connections on the left-side of the board, and 4 on the right. Servo cables are connected vertically, with 0V (the black or brown wire) at the bottom of the board.

Case Dimensions
---------------

The case measures 68x68x21mm. Don't forget that the cables will stick out.

Specification
-------------

|  Parameter                               |   Value   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Number of servo channels                 | 12        |
| Nominal input voltage                    | 11.1V ± 15% |
| Output voltage                           | 5.5V      |
| Maximum total output current [^1]        | 10A       |

[^1]: If the auxiliary input is connected, outputs 8-11 have an independent maximum current.
